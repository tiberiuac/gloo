### ReporterStatus

 
*
ReporterStatus indicates the Status of a resource according to each controller.

Note: ReporterStatus is intended to replace Status in resources. Resources may need both fields
in order to handle reading from older versions that do not yet use ReporterStatus; in this case
it is recommended and safe to move the existing Status and a new ReporterStatus into a oneof:
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#updating.

```yaml
"statuses": map<string, .core.solo.io.Status>

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `statuses` | `map<string, .core.solo.io.Status>` | Mapping from reporter to that reporter's Status. Key format: ${POD_NAMESPACE}:${Status.ReportedBy} (i.e. gloo-system:gloo, gloo-system:gateway, etc). |




---
### Status

 
*
Status indicates whether a resource has been (in)validated by a reporter in the system.
Statuses are meant to be read-only by users

```yaml
"state": .core.solo.io.Status.State
"reason": string
"reportedBy": string
"subresourceStatuses": map<string, .core.solo.io.Status>
"details": .google.protobuf.Struct

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `state` | [.core.solo.io.Status.State](../status.proto.sk/#state) | State is the enum indicating the state of the resource. |
| `reason` | `string` | Reason is a description of the error for Rejected resources. If the resource is pending or accepted, this field will be empty. |
| `reportedBy` | `string` | Reference to the reporter who wrote this status. |
| `subresourceStatuses` | `map<string, .core.solo.io.Status>` | Reference to statuses (by resource-ref string: "Kind.Namespace.Name") of subresources of the parent resource. |
